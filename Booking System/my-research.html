						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
						According to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">(creativecommons.org)</a>
						"The combination of our tools and our users is a vast and growing digital commons, a pool of content that can be copied, distributed, 
						edited, remixed, and built upon, all within the boundaries of copyright law".
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>"All Creative Commons licenses have many important features in common. Every license helps creators — we call them licensors
						if they use our tools — retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work — at least non-commercially.
						Every Creative Commons license also ensures licensors get the credit for their work they deserve. Every Creative Commons license works around 
						the world and lasts as long as applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on copyright). 
						These common features serve as the baseline, on top of which licensors can choose to grant additional permissions when deciding how they want 
						their work to be used."</p>

						for your websites and hopefully see more user traffic come through. Ideally being the first result that comes up after a search</p>  
						<br>
						<p>
						A quote from <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide">Google search central</a> States:</p>
						<br>
						<p>
						"You should build a website to benefit 
						your users, and gear any optimization toward making the user experience better. One of those users is a search engine, which helps other users discover your content.
						 SEO is about helping search engines understand and present content. Your site may
						be smaller or larger than our example site and offer vastly different content, but the optimization topics in this guide applies to sites of all sizes and types."

							<h4>WEB PERFOREMANCE AND MAINTANCE</h4>
							<img src="images/web_performance.jpg">
						</div>
						<div class="flip-box-back">
						<h4>Performance</h4>
						<p>Web performance is essential to a good website. this applies to both owner and user sides. This directly refers to the speed that a web page
						will load and indirectly how it performs to the use of a user and how well it does that.
						</p>  
						<p>
						a paragraph from <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-performance">hubspot</a> states: "Website
						performance measures how quickly the pages of a website load and display in the web browser. 
						Web performance optimization is the practice of improving website performance by various methods — 
						faster websites are said to be higher-performing."
						</p>
					
						<h4>Maintance</h4>
						<p>
						It is essnetial for a site to work well and have relivent content. just like house cleaing or looking after car you must do this regularly to 
						make sure it runs smoothe.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p> a paragraph from <a href="https://www.exai.com/blog/website-maintenance-services-costs#:~:text=Website%20maintenance%20is%20the%20process,your%20website%20visitors%20are%20happy.&text=Think%20of%20websites%20as%20something%20that%20needs%20to%20be%20oiled%20regularly.">
						EXAI</a> states "Website maintenance is the process of checking to see whether your website is healthy and performing well. 
						It’s about keeping up with security updates, fresh content, encouraging traffic growth, and making sure your website visitors are happy. 
						Website maintenance services are an essential ingredient for engaging and retaining your customers, thus strengthening your SEO and Google 
						rankings."
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
						both of these topics tie into eachother to ensure relivent and fast working sites that stay modenrn and usefull.

							<h4>WEB SECURITY</h4>
							<img style="height: 90%" src="images/security.jpg">
						</div>
						<div class="flip-box-back">
						<p>Cited from: <a href="https://www.mimecast.com/content/web-security/#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20web%20security%20refers,users%20and%20companies%20from%20risk.">Mimecast </a>
						"In general, web security refers to the protective measures and protocols that organizations adopt to protect the organization from, 
						cyber criminals and threats that use the web channel. Web security is critical to business continuity and to protecting data, users and 
						companies from risk."
						</p> 
						<br>
						<p>
						It is essential for anyone who uses data from their users and customers to be secure so that they can protect themselves and the intelectual property
						of their users. there is nothing worse than getting data stolen from you. Data is valuble. Make sure to protect it. Security can be a very 
						in depth and advanced topic to get into detail about. its allways reccomended to seek how you can protect yourself and your users, talk to a professional
						 and get their advice.
